Since the release of Windows 10 and Microsoft’s shift to a software-as-a-service model for their flagship operating system, the updates have been coming thick and fast. At least once a year Microsoft releases a major update for Windows 10, whether you want it or not. There are also numerous small updates that range from critical security patches to more trivial cosmetic and minor changes. 

When everything is working correctly, you’ll hardly know anything is happening at all. When Windows update errors happen however, the result can be anything from blocked updates to a computer that no longer works! 

## What causes the Windows Update failing error?

 *Corrupt or missing system files.** System files are crucial to make sure everything works on your device. There’s a possibility that your system files were corrupted or deleted recently, which causes Windows Update to fail.
 *Outdated drivers.** Drivers are needed to handle components that don’t natively come with Windows 10 compatibility such as graphic cards, network cards, and so on. If a driver related to this issue hasn’t been updated in a while, it can cause issues with Windows Update.
 *An issue with the Windows Update service.** There’s a possibility that something is wrong with your update service itself. If this is the case, you can find alternative ways to download the latest Windows 10 update below.
